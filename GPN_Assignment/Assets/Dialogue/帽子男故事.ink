Warrior Amilia, quick! Follow the main squad and evacuate from here, forget about me!
Remu fortress is my home, the place where I lived happily with my wife.
A few years ago she died, I shall keep her company by staying here.
I want to protect Remu fortress till the end.
Even after hundreds of brave warriors sacrificing themselves, 
is it still not enough to stop this tragedy from happening?
